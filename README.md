# SelfOrganizingMaps

I set up a Self Organizing Map (SOM), what helps to identify those bank customers, who tend to commit fraud during the credit card application. In a second step, I used an Artificial Neural Network to calculate the fraud probabilities for each of the identified customers. 

Inspired by udemy course Deep Learning A-Z.
